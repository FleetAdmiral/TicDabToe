## The Rules
1. [​ FIRST MOVE​ ] The very first move of the game is an open move, i.e. Any cell on the
entire board is valid.

2. [​ CORRESPONDENCE RULE​ ] If the opponent places his/her marker in any of the cells,
then you need to place your marker anywhere in the block corresponding to the cell.
For example, if a player places his marker in the top left cell of some block, the next
player needs to move in any of the open cells in the top left block. Similarly for the right
center cell, right center block is open. Please refer to the code for more clarity.

3. [​ ABANDON RULE​ ] Once a block is won by a player, it has to be abandoned. That is,
you may consider the entire block to be full and no other player may play in that block.

4. [​ FREE MOVE RULE​ ] In case all of the cells in the destined block obtained from Rule 2
are occupied or the destined block is abandoned as per Rule 3, then the player may
move in any free cell in the entire board.

5. [​ WIN RULE​ ] The player who wins any four consecutive cells in a block which are either
a row, column or diagonal wins the block and the player who wins any four
consecutive blocks of the board, wins the game and the game is over. If all the cells
are filled, and no pattern has been formed then the game is over.

## Scoring
Winning a game, by forming a pattern as described in [WIN RULE] will give you
16 points.

If the player makes an invalid move, or exceeds time limit, or makes an illegal
change to the board, or uses threading or makes any system call, then the
opponent earns 16 points and the player earns 0 points.

If no player has a pattern at the end of the game, both the players get points
equal to the number of blocks they have won respectively.
